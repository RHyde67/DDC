This is not my work and is downloadable from Matlab's file exchange. For details see the file headers.\r\n\r\n**gaussian5000.csv** - data file containg 5 random clusters of gaussian distributed data of 5000+ samples for cluster. This is the type of data distributions best suited to DDC.\r\n\r\n**DS2.csv** - standard test dataset of arbitrarily shaped data groups. Although DDC will created correct, pure clusters this data shows the limitations of DDC in working with non-standard data distrbutions. (To work with this type of data, see DDCAS, Data Density based Clustering for Arbitrary Shapes.)\r\n",
